NiraProxy plugin for SiriProxy
==================================================
This is a Plugin for [SiriProxy](https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) to use the awesome [NiraProxy](http://proxy.niranda.net)-API.
There is an ever-growing library of commands for a human-like language, as seen on the iDevices.
Please have a look at the great Wiki.

How it works
--------------------------------------------------
The NiraProxy plugin for [SiriProxy](https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) forwards an inquiry-string to the [NiraProxy](http://proxy.niranda.net)-API. The request is being processed, information is being gathered and an answer is sent back to the [SiriProxy](https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy)

Requirement
--------------------------------------------------
This plugin makes use of Niranda's [NiraProxy](http://proxy.niranda.net), so the [SiriProxy](https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) have to be connected to the internet (Port: 80).
